This plugin allows your visitors (logged in OR Not) to submit posts to your site via a sidebar widget form, or a custom shortcode in a page or post of your choice.
This is a very easy way to get your visitors to engage on your website. The idea came from a client who wanted a way to let members of their congregation post articles in the main church's website
