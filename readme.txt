This plugin allows your visitors (logged in) to submit posts to your site via a simple sidebar widget form.

== Description ==

This plugin allows your visitors (logged in OR Not) to submit posts to your site via a sidebar widget form, or a custom shortcode in a page or post of your choice.
This is a very easy way to get your visitors to engage on your website. We will have a premium module that will allow users whose emails don't exist in the database to be added immediately. 
It comes  with a javascript form validation (user can't submit post if some fields are empty), and once the post has been submitted it is saved as a draft.
